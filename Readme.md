## Future Plans

Currently using a simple PHP PDO API for simplicity. Ideally we will migrate to a Symfony Skeleton API, but that might be more hassle than it is worth

Adding more admin functionality: Sync Channels.

Adding support for subdomains in order to access separate databases / tables for different catalogs.
