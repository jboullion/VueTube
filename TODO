1. Move Homepage Channels to Vuex
2. Add Basic Authentication
	a. Logging in allows access to the "Admin" area where channels can be added or edited.
3. Flesh out the Add and Edit channel forms.
	a. Needs validation
	b. Should create channel entry and also query videos (100? 1000?)
		i. Edit doesn't need to update videos, just information and channel image
4. Get VideoList scrolling working.
	a. Use handles on desktop and touch on mobile. See old code
5. Search Functionality
	a. Setup a channel search for the front page.
	b. Channel OR Video Search toggle?
	c. Channel Filters
		i. Style
		ii. Focus
	d. Videos don't have filters since that would have to be done manually?
		i. Can we get the tags appied to each video?
	e. Order?
		i. Order channels or videos
		ii. Alpha Order / Popularity? We could track the videos watched of users to learn which channels are most popular
5. Account Pages
	a. Favorite Videos listed in account area
	b. Video Watch History
	c. Search both of these lists
	d. Profile Information?
		i. Ultimately we will be using the Google Authentication so probably don't need to store profile info.
6. MISC
	a. On Hover over a video you can add to "Watch Later"?
	b. Make the ChannelList layout feel a little more "tight".
		i. This might simply be a responsiveness issue.
		ii. Shrink channel image?
		iii. Layout icons different on desktop?
X. Decide to move this into WordPress OR build a Symfony API
	a. WordPress would be much quicker and allows piggybacking off of a lot of features
		i. Caching the HTML should provide initial load times comparable to Symfony.
		ii. Investigate how much a PITA WordPress routes would be.
		iii. Perhaps WordPress should be headless? Move it into an "Admin" or "WordPress" folder?
		iv. https://snipcart.com/blog/wordpress-vue-headless
	b. Symfony would be much less bloat and Ultimately smaller and faster, though with fewer features
Y. Upload to jboullion.com under a subdomain
	a. mytube.jboullion.com?
Z. (OPTIONAL)
	a. Better Animations!
		i. Favorite should pulse / "beat" like a heart
	b. Update Styling
		i. Find a designer and have them give tips on typography, colors, and everything else

	a. Analytics
		i. Watch Time
		ii. Videos per session?
